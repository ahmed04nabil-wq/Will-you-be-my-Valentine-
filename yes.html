    <h1>Yay! I knew you'd say yes, my everything ❤️</h1>

    <p>You're the first person who made me feel truly safe being soft. I still get butterflies when you text me. I still get nervous when I’m about to tell you something deep, even though I know you’ll never judge me (hopefully). I still catch myself smiling at my phone like an idiot when your name pops up. Loving you is easy, it’s the easiest and most natural thing I’ve ever done.</p>

    <p>I want you to know you can fall apart with me whenever you need to. Cry, be tired, be messy, be quiet, I’m not going anywhere. I’ll sit in the silence with you, hold you when words aren’t enough, kiss your forehead when you’re overthinking, and remind you every single day that you are enough. More than enough. You’re my favorite person in every version of every day.</p>

    <p>I used to think “forever” was just a pretty word people said. But with you… it doesn’t feel scary or impossible anymore. It feels like the only thing that makes sense. I want every tomorrow with you. The boring ones, the hard ones, the silly ones where we laugh until our stomachs hurt. Still falling for you every single day. </p>
    <p>Thank you for saying yes. I love youuu sooo muchhh. And I’m going to spend the rest of my life making sure you feel that love every single day. You’re my home, Aribah. Always.</p>

    <p>Happy Valentine’s Day, my love. I’m never letting go. ❤️</p>
